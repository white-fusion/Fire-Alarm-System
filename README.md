<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
This system checks for abnormal smoke content in a room every two seconds. Under abnormal conditions it throws open two doors and two windows and opens a valve that releases the gas to put-out the fire. An Alarm is also sounded; this alarm is sounded until the smoke level in the room drops to an acceptable level. The smoke detection system is made up of two smoke sensors placed on the ceiling of the room. When the smoke level comes back below the danger level, the doors, windows and valves are closed. 
 
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented the fire alarm system that checks for abnormal smoke content in a room.</li>
